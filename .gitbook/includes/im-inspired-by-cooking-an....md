title: Done!

I’m inspired by cooking, _a_~~_ntique to_~~_ols,_ holidays, the color of steel, folk art, candles, (I could go on) but the thread I keep following is _celebration_. Celebration can mean party hats and giants cakes, but it can also simply mean lighting a candle for dinner on a regular ol’ week night. These glimpses of reverence carry us through our lives. We all have the power to make ordinary moments special - and that’s why I make art.
