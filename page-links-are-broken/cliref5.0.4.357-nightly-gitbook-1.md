# CliRef5.0.4.357 nightly gitbook (1)

This is a very large CLI reference. Before I convert it into GitBook-optimized Markdown (applying the rules you gave: advanced blocks where appropriate, removing navigation clutter, converting long numbered steps to steppers, turning package-manager install blocks into tabs, turning FAQs into expandables, etc.), could you confirm scope?

Do you want:

* The entire file converted into GitBook-ready Markdown (very large output), or
* Only selected top-level sections (for example "weka agent", "weka cluster", "weka fs", etc.) to be converted now and the rest later?

If you pick the latter, tell me which sections to process first. If you pick the entire file, I’ll produce the complete converted Markdown.
