Storylane records the full, no-code replica (HTML and CSS) of each screen, allowing you to fully tailor it later for your audience. Best when you need to edit screens and create a sales demo environment.

(For example, capturing your product's dashboard to personalize the logo for different customers, remove/blur elements, add different personalization tokens, add media, or customize HTML...)
