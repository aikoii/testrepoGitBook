The Help Center lets you publish public articles and provide your customers with faster support. You can automatically suggest articles to answer common questions, and let your customers quickly help themselves before they chat. You can easily create articles, share them with customers as you chat, and gather feedback to help you improve your content.

## Customize your Help Center

Start by [customizing](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/56644-customize-your-help-center) your Help Center to match your brand.

You can also [choose a language](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/3107388-support-multiple-languages-in-your-help-center#configure-your-help-center-to-support-multiple-languages) for your Help Center and add links to your website or social media accounts.

If you use Google Analytics, we recommend [adding your tracking ID](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/1346547-integrate-google-analytics-with-your-help-center) to your Help Center. This allows you to gain further insights into how your users are interacting with your articles.

## Set up a custom domain (optional)

If you’d prefer to have your Help Center available at your own subdomain like “help.exampleapp.io”, you can set a [custom domain](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/56644-customize-your-help-center#h_b58f0d6f8d).

<figure><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/tx2p130c/1762985601/1b1c3e5ae79be976c3e606295c3e/CleanShot+2025-10-06+at+10_09_04%402x.png?expires=1763514900&#x26;signature=8d14ab3ecaaf35c666723384bc10e7c4148c6fa84a8a0e2c96df8d061288e594&#x26;req=dSchFMB2mIdfWPMW1HO4zY%2Ff%2BEqlirCsLUc5W97LJxVl79p61WlFvva36jqB%0ARqG89%2Bz%2FIB8g%2BPOOzm0%3D%0A" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you'd like to [keep certain articles private](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/2982784-control-who-can-see-your-articles-with-audience-targeting), you'll need a custom domain to enable audience targeting.

## Write your first articles and add them to collections

Once you’ve got your Help Center set up, you should [write your first article](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/9357931-create-and-manage-public-articles). If you’re not sure what to write about, check out our [guide to writing help articles](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/8916416-guide-to-writing-help-articles).

It’s easy to [format your articles](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/56978-format-an-article), and your draft articles will look exactly the same as when you push them live, so you'll know how your article looks before you publish it.

If you have an Intercom Help Center and Inbox, you can [share articles in conversations](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/6564531-share-articles-to-answer-questions-faster) with your customers immediately.

For articles to appear in your Help Center, you’ll need to [add them to a collection](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/56647-create-collections-in-your-help-cente). Collections help you keep your Help Center organized and make it easier for your customers to find the information they need.

Articles must be part of a collection in order to search for them in your Help Center.

## **Creating and Organizing Collections**

Go to [Settings > Help Center > \[Your Help Center\]](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/_/settings/helpcenter/166/collections) and click **New collection:**

<figure><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/tx2p130c/1763028397/15d0d9df357f0b2ba3f77ddd31a1/CleanShot+2025-10-06+at+10_30_19%402x.png?expires=1763514900&#x26;signature=65a3a5e785899cc16bd566efb7d1e7a780f73a212431b0f22dba2f025ea9b87a&#x26;req=dSchFcl8lYJWXvMW1HO4zWl3vLth723%2FG5Yw%2FZcQ6hv%2FeF2dt2RuvAaS7d8z%0AQKQS7PR%2FdYOkiJMZgA0%3D%0A" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Name your collection, select an icon from the dropdown menu (or upload a custom icon) and give it a short description. Collection descriptions provide important context for people who scan your Help Center.

**Add articles or create nested collections** by clicking **three dots "..."** next to the collection.

Drag and drop your existing collections or articles to reorder them.

**Note:** You can only add icons for first-level collections. All sub-collections will have the default folder icon.

It is not supported for a nested collection to sit on top of a parent collection's articles. Nested collections will stay at the bottom.

​

## Turn your Help Center on

The final step is to make your Help Center accessible to customers and available to search engines. Go to [Settings > Help Center](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/_/settings/helpcenter/166/collections) and set it **Live** from the dropdown menu at the top.
